HistoryProvenanceTrackerMetric
/**

 * 
 * According the the Data on the Web BP W3C WG, "consumers
 * need to know the origin or history of the published data... 
 * data published should include or link to provenance information".
 * 
 * In the Extended Provenance Metric, the "origin" problem is tackled.
 * This metric will identify discrepancies between the creation date
 * and the modified date (this alone would also be a good indicator),
 * and then checking if there are prov:Revision instances leading up
 * to the last modified date.
